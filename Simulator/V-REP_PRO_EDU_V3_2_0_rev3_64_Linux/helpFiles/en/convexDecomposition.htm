<h1>Convex decomposition</h1>


<p>V-REP allows calculating and adding the convex decomposition  of specified <a href="shapes.htm">shapes</a>. Convex shapes perform faster and are more stable that random shapes, in regards to dynamic collision response calculation. They are however not as fast nor as stable as <a href="shapes.htm">pure shapes</a>! </p>

<p>You can either add the convex decomposition of selected shapes, or you can morph selected shapes into their convex decomposition equivalent:</p>

<li><strong>adding the convex decomp. </strong>: [Menu bar --&gt; Add --&gt; Convex decomposition of selected shapes]</li>
<li><strong>morphing into convex decomp. </strong>: [Menu bar --&gt; Edit --&gt; Morph selected shapes into convex shapes]</li>



<p>Following dialog pops open and allows adjusting the way shapes are decomposed:</p>

<br>

<p>Following parameters are applied for each individual shape:</p>

<li><strong>Handle grouped shape components individually</strong>: when checked, then each individual mesh of a grouped shape will be handled on its own during decomposition, otherwise the grouped shape is considered as a single mesh.</li>
<li><strong>Apply random colors for easier entity distinction</strong>: has only a visual impact.</li>
<li><strong>Add extra points</strong>: specifies whether extra points should be added when computing the concavity.</li>
<li><strong>Add extra face points</strong>: specifies whether faces points should be added when computing the concavity.</li>
<li><strong>Min. nb of clusters</strong>: specifies the minimum number of clusters to be generated</li>
<li><strong>Max. concavity</strong>: specifies the maximum allowed concavity.</li>
<li><strong>Max. connection distance</strong>: specifies the maximum allowed distance to get convex clusters connected.</li>
<li><strong>Target nb of triangles of decimated mesh</strong>: specifies the targeted number of triangles of the decimated mesh.</li>
<li><strong>Max. nb of vertices / convex hull</strong>: specifies the maximum number of vertices for each generated convex hull.</li>
<li><strong>Small cluster detection threshold (%)</strong>: specifies the threshold to detect small clusters. The threshold is expressed as a percentage of the total mesh surface.</li>
<li><strong>Max. iterations</strong>: the convex decomposition algorithm operates in an approximate way, which means that created shapes might be more or less convex. V-REP uses its own convexivity measure: a shape is considered convex only if all of its vertices lie within the half-volumes defines by all triangular faces, and this with a tolerance of 1.5% of the shape's average bounding box side length. The <strong>max. iterations</strong> parameter allows to iterate several times over the created meshes if they don't appear as convex enough to V-REP.</li>
